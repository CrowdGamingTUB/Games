Tap the Black Tiles
======================

A free clone of Don't Tap the White Tiles (aka Piano Tiles).

## How to play

Just tap the black tiles before they get out of the screen. Oh, and don't tap
the white tiles ;)

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome :) Just fork this project and make a pull
request.

Note that you can easily add custom modes by adding/overloading functions in the
JSON object `modes`. If you don't understand how to do it just by looking at
the code, or if you have an idea for a mode but you aren't a javascript
developer, feel free to contact me at 316k *ät* legtux *döt* org.

## License

This code is licensed under the MIT license, because it's free, *libre*
and short enough to be actually read by people.
